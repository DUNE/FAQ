# Account Renewals

**It may take up to 4-6 weeks for computing accounts (and/or site access) to be granted, please take that into account for your application.**

If you have been a Fermilab user and need to renew your DUNE account (and Fermilab credentials) you will fill out the Access Request Form. Be sure to choose DUNE - DEEP UNDERGROUND NEUTRINO EXPERIMENT as your experiment and use ONLY Maxine Hronek as your Point of Contact. Support documentation for this whole process including a video can be found at the [FNAL Campus Access page](https://get-connected.fnal.gov/accessandbadging/access/) Take note of the DUNE specific details below. These are the [Fermilab directions](https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012399).

**Be sure to start your renewal process the moment you get your reminder email (4-6 weeks before expiration), as approval may take some time**

### Answers to specific questions:  

**Provide your OrcID**  https://orcid.org if you don't have one.  
**Point of Contact name:** Maxine Hronek
In some cases, Maxine will email you to ask you and/or your Institutional Contact some additional questions, please modify these as needed for your particular case. Note that your account renewal will NOT proceed until these are answered:
1. **Subjects and Technology:** DUNE Data Analysis
2. **Location and Area accessed:** None (Remote Only)
3. **Computing access:** DUNE - DEEP UNDERGROUND NEUTRINO EXPERIMENT computing account and services



**When will you need access to Fermilab's computing systems?:** Choose dates for one year starting at your account expiration date. Note that you will get a renewal email sixty days before your remote computing access expires, you may need a full 4-6 weeks to get the renewal complete, we strongly encourage submitting the form as soon as you get the first email.

**Onsite access:** if your plans include more than one visit over a year, please put a full range of dates and intermittent. Be sure to have your Remote access a full year to continue your computing access. If you select Fermilab housing, you will need to contact them separately to make arrangements.

**Home Institution:** For your Home Institution - the institution/place from which you are employed should be entered.

**Institution point of contact name:** Your institutional point of contact name should be the DUNE person, from your institution, that can vouch for your work on DUNE, and may be required to answer questions by email for your account renewal to proceed.

**Complete and submit your request.** You will receive e-mail notifications about the status of your request. Certain stages of the process may take up to four-six weeks.

After the application is submitted, you may be contacted to provide more information. That includes, but is not limited to a requirement from the DOE: "Effective February 1, 2019, all non-U.S. citizens who request new (or renewed) onsite or remote access may require the submission of a curriculum vitae (CV)/resume". Questions are given on the Fermilab application detailing what is needed for the CV.

You will get emails about doing onboarding with [FermiWorks](https://wd5.myworkday.com/wday/authgwy/fermilab/login.htmld), be sure to check your Junk/Spam folders for those. More documentation about this can be found at the [User's Office page](https://get-connected.fnal.gov/accessandbadging/access/).

Note, you will end up with 3 accounts.  [FermiWorks](https://wd5.myworkday.com/wday/authgwy/fermilab/login.htmld) contains your personal information.  Your Services Account provides SSO access to documentation such as DUNE docdb.  Your Unix/Kerberos accounts allow access to computing systems.

Basic Computer Security training is required to be completed at the time the request for a new or renewed account is made. There will be a link to the training material on the request form, and you must provide confirmation that you completed training upon form submission.

**Any additional account renewal needs:**
To change your password(s), you can consult the [CMS hints for passwords](https://uscms.org/uscms_at_work/computing/getstarted/password_fermilab.shtml).
Note that if you are changing experiments at Fermilab to CMS, you will need to put in a new DUNE account request to create a DUNE account for you after your FNAL credentials are renewed. Just choosing DUNE as the experiment for a Fermilab renewal if you did NOT have a DUNE account before will not have a new DUNE account created for you.

Go to [DUNE Requests](
https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/wp/?id=evg-catitem-browse&spa=1&sys_id=481cf6b6db7636005b1aff621f961954&sysparm_searchstr=DUNE) and choose "Apply for DUNE Computing Accounts
(already have FNAL ID)"

If you have changed institute between renewals, please contact the Fermilab Users Office to assist in getting the information changed at Fermilab.
